		<description>A fragile yet beautiful golden flower. Engineered as part of a large terraforming program that turned wild. Its petals can be harvested and processed into a gel-like elixir which in addition to healing properties, it also rapidly develops a dependence on the user. It takes a very long time to grow and needs a mild temperature in order to bloom. Adding to that the addiction problem, GildedBloom quickly became a rarity.</description>
